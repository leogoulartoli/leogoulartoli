### Hi there 👋

You can call me Leo

I'm passionate about programming and design. I've worked with javascript(ReactJS, Angular and NodeJS) since 2018. 

Some facts about me:
  * I've worked as a Design Freelancer before programming.
  * I live in small city called Cosmorama in Brazil.
  * I love playing the piano.
